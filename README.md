# Reinforcement Learning-Based Path Planning for Wheeled Mobile Robots

## Overview

Pathfinding is a crucial aspect of autonomous robotics, especially in environments with uncertainties. This project focuses on implementing a reinforcement learning-based approach for efficient path planning in wheeled mobile robots. By leveraging sensors to perceive the environment, the robot learns to navigate from any given start point to a destination, adapting to uncertainties along the way.

## Key Features

- **Reinforcement Learning**: The core of the project involves training the wheeled mobile robot using reinforcement learning techniques. The robot learns to make decisions based on its interactions with the environment, continually improving its pathfinding abilities.

- **Sensor Integration with ROS**: Sensors are utilized to perceive the environment, and the Robot Operating System (ROS) is employed to configure and manage these sensors. This integration enhances the robot's awareness of its surroundings.

- **Path Visualization with Rviz**: The Rviz tool is utilized for visualizing the entire path and its surroundings in the environment. This visualization aids in assessing the accuracy and efficiency of the path planning achieved through reinforcement learning.
